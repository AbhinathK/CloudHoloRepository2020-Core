This is an existing implementation of a lung and airway segmentation from CT scans, taken from https://github.com/wanwanbeen/ct_lung_segmentation (commit [120f617(https://github.com/wanwanbeen/ct_lung_segmentation/commit/120f617089a759d1fbf569cc78c21987fd6335aa)).

It is unchanged, except for these changes:
